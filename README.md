# Decentralized Social Media!

This project is a basic social media/blog implementation using smart contracts written in solidity, The Graph querying protocol, and nextJS framework. This is deployed on the Mumbia testNet of the Polygon network.

Visit https://rad-florentine-d57e62.netlify.app/ and login with your MetaMask wallet to join in the shared feed between any users of the network. You will even get to create your own nickname to be more user friendly than cryptic wallet addresses. 

Make sure you have Test Matic tokens in your account. You can get those from this faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
